# Chapter 13: Governance & The Path to DAO

METAsol is designed for progressive decentralization, ensuring that the future of the ecosystem is ultimately placed in the hands of its community. This transition will occur in three distinct phases.

* **Phase 1: Foundation-Led Growth (Launch - Year 2):** In the initial phase, the SOLNEX Foundation will govern the protocol's parameters to ensure stability, rapid development, and strategic execution.

* **Phase 2: Community Proposals & Off-Chain Voting (Year 2-3):** We will introduce a governance forum and a Snapshot-style voting portal. $METASOL holders will be able to create proposals and vote on key decisions, such as new trading strategies for the engine or the allocation of treasury funds.

* **Phase 3: Full On-Chain DAO Implementation (Year 4+):** The final phase is the transition to a full, on-chain Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). At this stage, control over the core protocol and its treasury will be transferred to a smart contract-based governance system controlled entirely by $METASOL token holders.
